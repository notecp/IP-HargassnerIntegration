## Installation Methods

### Method 1: HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Click on "Integrations"
3. Click the 3 dots in the top right corner
4. Select "Custom repositories"
5. Add repository URL: `https://github.com/bauer-group/IP-HargassnerIntegration`
6. Select category: "Integration"

8. Click "Install" on the Hargassner Pellet card
9. Restart Home Assistant

### Method 2: Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from GitHub
2. Extract the archive
3. Copy `custom_components/hargassner_pellet` to your Home Assistant's `custom_components` directory:
   ```
   <config_dir>/custom_components/hargassner_pellet/
   ```
4. Restart Home Assistant

### Verify Installation

Check Home Assistant logs for:
```
INFO (MainThread) [homeassistant.setup] Setting up hargassner_pellet
```

## Configuration

### Step 1: Enable Telnet on Boiler

Consult your boiler's manual to enable the telnet interface (usually port 23).

**Note:** Telnet is unencrypted. Only use on trusted networks!

### Step 2: Get Boiler IP Address

Find your boiler's IP address:
- Check boiler display/menu
- Check router's DHCP client list
- Use network scanner

**Tip:** Configure a static IP or DHCP reservation for stability.

### Step 3: Test Connection

From any computer on the same network:
```bash
telnet <boiler-ip> 23
```

You should see messages like:
```
pm 7 10.1 9.0 67.4 70 64.5 65 11 91.3 26 27.0 ...
```

Press Ctrl+C to exit.

### Step 4: Add Integration

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **+ Add Integration**
3. Search for **Hargassner Pellet**
4. Fill in the configuration form:

   - **IP Address:** Enter boiler's IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
   - **Firmware Version:** Select your boiler's version
     - Check boiler display or manual
     - If unsure, try `V14_1HAR_q1` (most common)
   - **Device Name:** Choose a friendly name (default: "Hargassner")
   - **Language:** Select EN (English) or DE (German)
   - **Sensor Set:**
     - **STANDARD** - Essential sensors (~15 entities)
     - **FULL** - All available sensors (~30+ entities)

5. Click **Submit**

The integration will test the connection. If successful, sensors will be created.

### Step 5: Verify Sensors

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click on **Hargassner Pellet**
3. Check that sensors are populated with data

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Failed

**Problem:** "Failed to connect to boiler"

**Solutions:**
1. Verify IP address is correct
2. Check telnet is enabled on boiler
3. Test with `telnet <ip> 23` from command line
4. Check firewall settings
5. Verify Home Assistant and boiler are on same network/VLAN

### No Data / Sensors Show Unknown

**Problem:** Sensors are created but show "Unknown"

**Solutions:**
1. Wait 10-20 seconds for initial data
2. Check Home Assistant logs:
   ```yaml
   logger:
     default: info
     logs:
       custom_components.hargassner_pellet: debug
   ```
3. Verify firmware version is correct
4. Check for parsing errors in logs

### Wrong Firmware Version Selected

**Problem:** Sensors show incorrect values or parsing errors

**Solutions:**
1. Remove integration
2. Re-add with different firmware version
3. Check boiler manual for correct version
4. Enable debug logging to see message format

### Encoding Issues (Special Characters)

**Problem:** Degree symbols (°) show as � or other characters

**Solutions:**
1. Check logs for encoding warnings
2. Integration automatically tries UTF-8, Latin-1, CP1252
3. If problem persists, create GitHub issue with sample messages

### Connection Drops Frequently

**Problem:** Integration keeps disconnecting

**Solutions:**
1. Check network stability
2. Verify no other devices are using telnet to boiler
3. Check boiler doesn't have telnet timeout configured
4. Review logs for specific error messages

## Advanced Configuration

### Changing Options

You can change language and sensor set without removing the integration:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **Configure** on Hargassner Pellet
3. Change settings
4. Click **Submit**
5. Reload integration or restart Home Assistant

### Multiple Boilers

To add multiple boilers:
1. Each boiler needs a unique IP address
2. Add integration separately for each
3. Use different device names to distinguish them

### Energy Dashboard Integration

The integration automatically creates an energy sensor compatible with HA's Energy Dashboard:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Dashboards** → **Energy**
2. Click **Add Consumption**
3. Select **Hargassner Energy Consumption** sensor
4. Configure as needed

## Firewall Configuration

### Home Assistant Firewall

Allow outbound connections to boiler:
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Port:** 23
- **Destination:** Boiler IP

### Network Firewall

If boiler is on different subnet:
- Allow TCP port 23 from HA to boiler
